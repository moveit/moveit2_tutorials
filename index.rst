MoveIt 2 Documentation
======================

Welcome to the unified MoveIt documentation, which includes tutorials, how-to-guides, core concepts, and more.

MoveIt 2 is the robotic manipulation platform for ROS 2, and incorporates the latest advances in motion planning, manipulation, 3D perception, kinematics, control, and navigation. MoveIt 2 was first released in 2019; for ROS 1 documentation, see `MoveIt 1 tutorials <https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials>`_.
