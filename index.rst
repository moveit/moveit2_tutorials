In these tutorials, the Franka Emika Panda robot is used as a quick-start demo. Alternatively, you can easily use any robot that has already been configured to work with MoveIt - check the `list of robots running MoveIt <http://moveit.ros.org/robots/>`_ to see whether MoveIt is already available for your robot. Otherwise, you can setup MoveIt to work with your custom robot in the tutorial section "Integration with a New Robot", below.

MoveGroup - ROS Wrappers in C++
------------------------------------------
The simplest way to use MoveIt through scripting is using the ``move_group_interface``. This interface is ideal for beginners and provides unified access to many of the features of MoveIt.

Using MoveIt Directly Through the C++ API
------------------------------------------
Building more complex applications with MoveIt often requires developers to dig into MoveItâ€™s C++ API. As an added plus, using the C++ API directly skips many of the ROS Service/Action layers resulting in significantly faster performance.

Integration with a New Robot
----------------------------
Before attempting to integrate a new robot with MoveIt 2, check whether your robot has already been setup (see the `list of robots running MoveIt <http://moveit.ros.org/robots/>`_). Otherwise, follow the tutorials in this section to integrate your robot with MoveIt (and share your results on the MoveIt mailing list)
