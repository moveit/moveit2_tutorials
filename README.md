# MoveIt 2 Tutorials

**NOTE: This repository is a new fork from the [MoveIt 1 tutorials](https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/) and needs your help with porting old tutorials to ROS 2.** To claim a tutorial to support the port of, see the Issues list. Thanks!

[See the live MoveIt2 tutorials here](http://moveit2_tutorials.picknik.ai/)

This is the primary documentation for the MoveIt project. We strongly encourage you to help improve MoveIt's documentation. Please consider reading the guidelines below for writing the best documentation and tutorials. However, if you are uncomfortable with any of the approaches, simply adding documentation text to your pull requests is better than nothing.

These tutorials use the [reStructuredText](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html) format commonly used in the Sphinx "Python Documentation Generator". This unfortunately differs from the common Markdown format, but its advantage is that it supports embedding code directly from source files for inline code tutorials.

All content in this repository is open source and released under the [BSD License v3](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause). Each individual source code file should contain a copy of the license.

This repository is currently built automatically by two systems. Travis builds the documentation for Melodic and ROS Build Farm builds the documentation for older versions:

## Getting Started 
An issue has been created for each tutorial to be ported to Foxy. At the top of each tutorial there is a tag: ":moveit1:", remove the tag 
after the tutorial has been successfully updated.

Below are some links to help with the ports. 

* [colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/how-to.html)
* [ament](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Ament-CMake-Documentation/)
* [rclcpp](http://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/rclcpp/index.html)

## Versions

- ``main`` latest, changes should target this branch

## MoveIt2 Tutorials Source Build

Follow the [MoveIt 2 Source Build](https://moveit.ros.org/install-moveit2/source/) instructions to setup a colcon workspace with moveit2 from source.

Cd into your moveit2 colcon workspace:

    cd $COLCON_WS/src

Download Moveit2_tutorials Source Code

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros-planning/moveit2_tutorials/main/moveit2_tutorials.repos
    vcs import < moveit2_tutorials.repos
    rosdep install -r --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro foxy -y

Configure and build the workspace:

    cd $COLCON_WS
    colcon build --event-handlers desktop_notification- status- --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

## Build HTML Pages Locally

If you want to test the tutorials by generating the html pages locally on your machine, you will first need to build the `rosdoc_lite` and `genmsg` packages from source (they are included in the moveit2_tutorials.repos file), and then you can use the ``build_locally`` script.
Run in the root of the moveit2_tutorials package:

    export ROS_DISTRO=foxy  # 20.04

    cd $COLCON_WS/src/moveit2_tutorials
    source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash
    ./build_locally.sh

The local website ``<LOCAL_PACKAGE_PATH>/build/html/index.html`` should automatically open in your web browser.

## ROS Build Farm Deployment

For deploying documentation changes to the web, [Section 3 of rosdoc_lite wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/rosdoc_lite) says that "rosdoc_lite is automatically run for packages in repositories that have rosinstall files listed in the rosdistro repository." This is done about once every 24 hours, [overnight](http://wiki.ros.org/rosdistro/Tutorials/Indexing%20Your%20ROS%20Repository%20for%20Documentation%20Generation).

## Contributing

We rely on the community to keep these tutorials up to date and bug free. If you find an issue with the tutorials please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2_tutorials/issues/new) or open a PR with proposed changes.

### Formatting and Style

**Code Formatting**

* These tutorials use the same [style guidelines](http://moveit.ros.org/documentation/contributing/code/) as the MoveIt project. When modifying or adding to these tutorials, it is required that code is auto formatted using [clang-format](http://moveit.ros.org/documentation/contributing/code/).
* Tutorials should exemplify best coding practices. If a contribution wouldn't pass review in the MoveIt project, then it shouldn't pass review in the tutorials.
* Relevant code should be included and explained using the ``.. tutorial-formatter::`` tag.
* Irrelevant code should be excluded from the generated html using the ``BEGIN_TUTORIAL``, ``END_TUTORIAL``, ``BEGIN_SUB_TUTORIAL``, and ``END_SUB_TUTORIAL`` tags.
* Whenever possible, links should be created using the ``extlinks`` dictionary defined in ``conf.py``.
* All demo code should be runnable from within the ``moveit_tutorials`` package.
* Python code should be run using ``rosrun``.

**Style**

* Each tutorial should be focused on teaching the user one feature or interface within MoveIt.
* Tutorials should flow from show to tell with videos and demos at the beginning followed by explanations.
* New tutorials should match the formatting, style and flow of existing tutorials whenever possible.

### Directory Structure

* Each tutorial should live in its own subdirectory within the `./doc/ <>` directory.
* Add your tutorial to `index.rst` in the root directory.
* Tutorials should use the following directory structure omitting unnecessary files and subdirectories:

```
moveit2_tutorials/doc/
└── <tutorial_name>/
    ├── <tutorial_name>_tutorial.rst
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    ├── package.xml
    ├── setup.py
    ├── images/
    │   └── <tutorial_name>_<image_description>.png
    ├── include/
    │   └── <tutorial_name>/
    │       └── <include_header>.h                      # Any custom C++ library header files
    ├── launch/
    │   └── <tutorial_name>_tutorial.launch
    ├── src/
    │   ├── <tutorial_name>_tutorial.cpp                # Main C++ executable
    │   ├── <include_source>.cpp                        # Custom C++ library source files
    │   └── <tutorial_name>/
    │       ├── __init__.py
    │       ├── <tutorial_name>_tutorial.py             # Main Python executable
    │       └── <python_library>.py                     # Custom Python libraries
    └── test/                                           # Ideally tutorials have their own integration tests
        ├── <tutorial_name>_tutorial.test               # Launch file for tests
        ├── <tutorial_name>_tutorial_test.py            # Python tests for tutorial
        └── <tutorial_name>_tutorial_test.cpp           # C++ tests for tutorial
```

### Including Images and Videos
#### Images
The standard way to include an image in reStructuredText is
```
.. image:: filename.png
   :width: 700px
```

This assumes that `filename.png` is in the same folder as the source `.rst` file. Images linked in this way will automatically be copied to the appropriate folder in the build.

[External Documentation](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/images.html)

Do **not** include animated gifs as the file format leads to very large files. Use a video format like `webm` and see the section on local video below.

#### YouTube and other External Video
You can embed video with raw html, like in this example from the Pick and Place Tutorial.
```
.. raw:: html

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 5%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <iframe width="700px" height="400px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QBJPxx_63Bs?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
```
This includes [Youtube's suggested embed html](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en).

#### Local Video
To embed a video that is included in this repository, you also will use raw html, like this example from the Quickstart in RViz tutorial.

```
.. raw:: html

    <video width="700px" nocontrols="true" autoplay="true" loop="true">
        <source src="../../_static/rviz_joints_nullspace.webm" type="video/webm">
        The joints moving while the end effector stays still
    </video>
```

Note that the video file is in the `_static` folder instead of the same folder.
