Tutorials
=========

Tutorials are one of the most useful contributions you can make because they are the first thing many new users see.
We have separated the sections of this website based on `The Documentation System <https://documentation.divio.com/>`_.
Tutorials are **Learning-Oriented** and have these qualities:

* learning by doing
* inspiring confidence
* repeatability
* immediate sense of achievement
* concreteness, not abstraction
* minimum necessary explanation
* no distractions
* no options or decisions

In the end, the reader should feel a sense of accomplishment.
For that to happen, they need to play an active role throughout the tutorial.
Avoid the pattern of having a pre-made program that the user just executes followed by an explanation of the code.
Ideally each tutorial should extend the previous one to make them feel connected.

Tutorials are not the place for explaining nuanced abstractions or discussing decisions.
In order to foster learning by the newest users, they should build muscle memory around using the various components in MoveIt to do specific tasks.

When a user is going through the tutorials, avoid distracting them with potential rabbit holes as that will detract from their experience.
Save detailed explanations for the :doc:`/doc/concepts/concepts` pages on this site.
Place links to external sites and other resources at the end of the tutorial.

It is important that the tutorials are reviewed by those that are closest to the intended audience in terms of their amount of experience with MoveIt.

Awesome Examples

Here are some awesome examples to draw inspiration from for creating tutorials:

* `ROS 1 Tutorials <http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials>`_
* `The Rust Book <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>`_
* `CUDA Toolkit <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#introduction>`_
* `libuv book <http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/guide/introduction.html>`_

Diagrams can easily convey what words cannot.
Here are two websites that you can use to create diagrams to explain concepts quickly:

* `draw.io <https://draw.io>`_
* `excalidraw.com <https://excalidraw.com/>`_
