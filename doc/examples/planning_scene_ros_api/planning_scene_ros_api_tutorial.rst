Planning Scene ROS API
==================================

In this tutorial, we will examine the use of planning scene diffs to perform
two operations:

 * Adding and removing objects into the world
 * Attaching and detaching objects to the robot

Getting Started
---------------
If you haven't already done so, make sure you've completed the steps in :doc:`Getting Started </doc/tutorials/getting_started/getting_started>`.

Running the code
----------------
Open two shells. In the first shell start RViz and wait for everything to finish loading: ::

  ros2 launch moveit2_tutorials move_group.launch.py

In the second shell, run the launch file for this demo: ::

  ros2 launch moveit2_tutorials planning_scene_ros_api_tutorial.launch.py

After a short moment, the RViz window should appear and look similar to this step in the :ref:`Visualization Tutorial <doc/tutorials/quickstart_in_rviz/quickstart_in_rviz_tutorial:Rviz Visual Tools>`. To progress through each demo step either press the **Next** button in the **RvizVisualToolsGui** panel at the bottom of the screen or select **Key Tool** in the **Tools** panel at the top of the screen and then press **0** on your keyboard while RViz is focused.

Expected Output
---------------
In RViz, you should be able to see the following:
 * Object appears in the planning scene.
 * Object gets attached to the robot.
 * Object gets detached from the robot.
 * Object is removed from the planning scene.

The entire code
---------------
The entire code can be seen :codedir:`here in the MoveIt GitHub project<examples/planning_scene_ros_api>`.
