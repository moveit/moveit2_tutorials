# Configure pick_ik as the solver to use with panda_arm
panda_arm:
  kinematics_solver: pick_ik/PickIkPlugin  # The IK solver plugin to use
  kinematics_solver_timeout: 0.05  # Maximum duration in seconds the solver is allowed to run per attempt
  kinematics_solver_attempts: 3  # Maximum number of solver attempts to find a solution
  mode: global  # Solver mode 'global' enables evolutionary algorithm with gradient descent, and 'local' uses only gradient descent
  position_scale: 1.0  # A scale factor for the position cost, setting this to 0.0 means rotation-only IK
  rotation_scale: 0.5  # A scale factor for the orientation cost, setting this to 0.0 means position-only IK
  position_threshold: 0.001  # Threshold for position difference in meters to consider a solution valid
  orientation_threshold: 0.01  # Threshold for orientation difference in radians to consider a solution valid
  cost_threshold: 0.001  # Maximum cost function value for a valid solution (all cost functions must return a value lower than this)
  minimal_displacement_weight: 0.0  # Weight for joint angle difference cost function. Leave it low or zero for far goals, and make higher for interpolation or jogging
  gd_step_size: 0.0001  # Step size for the gradient descent
