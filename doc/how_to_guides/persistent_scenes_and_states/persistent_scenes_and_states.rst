Warehouse - Persistent Scenes and States
===========================================

The "MotionPlanning" plugin of RViz offers the possibility to save
complete planning scenes and robot states persistently.
Currently, two storage plugins (based on
`warehouse_ros <https://github.com/moveit/warehouse_ros>`_) are available:

* `warehouse_ros_mongo <https://github.com/moveit/warehouse_ros_mongo>`_, which uses MongoDB as backend
* `warehouse_ros_sqlite <https://github.com/moveit/warehouse_ros_sqlite>`_, which uses SQLite as backend

You can install both of them with your favourite package manager
(e.g. ``apt-get install ros-{DISTRO}-warehouse-ros-mongo``) or
:doc:`build them from source </doc/tutorials/getting_started/getting_started>`
(of course, you'll have to check out the corresponding repository into your ``src`` folder for that).

Storage plugin selection
------------------------

The warehouse plugin and settings have to be specified in the launch files of your MoveIt configuration.
You should adapt ``persistent_scenes_demo.launch.py`` if you do not wish to use the MongoDB plugin.
The storage plugin is determined by the parameter ``warehouse_plugin``.
Valid options are ``warehouse_ros_mongo::MongoDatabaseConnection`` for MongoDB and
``warehouse_ros_sqlite::DatabaseConnection`` for SQLite.
Furthermore, the parameters ``warehouse_host`` and ``warehouse_port`` configure the connection details.
In case of the SQLite plugin, ``warehouse_host`` contains the path to the database file,
and ``warehouse_port`` is unused.
If the database file does not exist yet, an empty database will be created.

Connecting to the storage backend
---------------------------------

To run the demo you need to install git lfs by running ``git lfs install`` and clone `moveit_benchmark_resources <https://github.com/moveit/moveit_benchmark_resources.git>`_ into your workspace.

After choosing the storage plugin and configuring the launch.py file,
run RViz using ::

   ros2 launch moveit2_tutorials persistent_scenes_demo.launch.py

In RViz, navigate to the "Context" tab of the "MotionPlanning" window.
Verify the connection details (host/port for MongoDB, file path for SQLite)
and click on "Connect".

After that, a dialogue box will appear and ask you whether you'd like to erase all current
states and scenes in RViz (not in the database, the persistent data is not affected by that).
As you just started RViz, you can safely select "yes".

Saving/Loading scenes and states
--------------------------------

Now that you connected successfully,
you can save and restore robot states and planned scenes.
This can be done in the "Stored Scenes" resp. "Stored States" tab in RViz.

To save a start state, drag the green manipulator to the correct position and click "Save Start".
The goal state (orange manipulator) can be saved with the "Save Goal" button.
To restore a state, select it in the list and click on "Set as Start" resp. "Set as Goal".
